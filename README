ioproxy is a tool for connecting I/O streams between unrelated
processes. If a process produces output readable by another unrelated
process, ioproxy can send that output to any other process, file,
socket (local or remote host), or user's terminal.

In addition to connecting I/O streams of different types, ioproxy can
multiplex several input streams into a single output stream or
duplicate a single input stream to multiple output streams.

For example, ioproxy can simultaneously 'tail -f' the same (or
different) files on different hosts, writing the output to the user's
terminal.

ioproxy can read data from a file on a remote host and write that data
to multiple files on any number of other remote hosts.

ioproxy can also be used to overcome some kinds of restrictions on
data transfer imposed by network firewall/filtering rules.

ioproxd, the daemon for long term I/O tasks, uses a configuration file
(default: /etc/ioproxyd.conf). The companion program, ioproxy takes
command line args and can be used for shorter, one-off tasks.

ioproxy is still in development phase.
