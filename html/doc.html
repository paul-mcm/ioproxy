<h2>ioproxy</h2>
<h4>proxy, multiplex/duplicate data streams across files/sockets of any type.</h4>
<p>
<b><u>INTRO</b></u><br>

<i>ioproxy</i> is a tool for connecting I/O streams between unrelated
processes.  If a process produces output readable by another unrelated
process, <i>ioproxy</i> can send that output to any other process, file, 
socket (local or remote host), or user's terminal.
</p>
<p>
In addition to connecting I/O streams of different types, <i>ioproxy</i> can
multiplex several input streams into a single output stream or
duplicate a single input stream to multiple output streams.
</p>
<p>

For example, <i>ioproxy</i> can simultaneously 'tail -f' the same (or
different) files on different hosts, writing the output to the user's
terminal.

</p>
<p>
<i>ioproxy</i> can read data from a file on a remote host and write
that data to multiple files on any number of other remote hosts.
</p>
<p>
<i>ioproxy</i> can also be used to overcome some kinds of restrictions on
data transfer imposed by network firewall/filtering rules.
</p>
<p>

<i>ioproxd</i> is the daemon for long term I/O tasks.  It takes a
configuration file (default: ioproxyd.conf).  The companion program,
<i>ioproxy</i> takes command line args and can be used for shorter,
one-off tasks.

</p>
<b><u>DETAILS</u></b><br>
<p>

<i>ioproxy</i> works with data streams. A data stream is designated as
either a <b>source</b>, from which data is read, or
<b>destination</b>, to which data is written.  <b>Sources</b> and
<b>destinations</b> of the I/O can be any of the following <b>I/O
types</b>:
</p>
<pre>
	1. TCP socket (server/client, with/without TLS)
	2. UDP socket (server/client)
	3. local, unix socket
	4. regular file
	5. FIFO
	6. STDIN
	7. STDOUT
	8. PIPE (STDIN or STDOUT of locally exec'd process) 
	9. SSH connection(source only*)
</pre>
<p>

(* Nums. 1-8 correspond roughly to standard unix 'file types' capable
of I/O.  Num. 9 is an authenticated ssh connection used for generating
data with ssh command execution.);

</p>
<p>
A basic configuration declares a <b>source</b> (e.g., I/O type FIFO) and a
<b>destination</b> (e.g., regular file).  Any data written to the <b>source</b> is
also written to the <b>destination</b>.
</p>
<p>

It's possible to declare a single <b>source</b> with multiple <b>destinations</b>.
In this case, data written to the <b>source</b> is copied to all
<b>destinations</b> (which need not be of the same I/O type).


</p>
<p>

The third possibility is a configuration that declares multiple
<b>sources</b> and a single <b>destination</b>.  Data written to any <b>source</b> is
copied to the <b>destination</b>. This kind of configuration has some unique
constraints that should be understood before being used.

</p>

<h2>Configuring ioproxy</h2>
<p>

A minimal <b>configuration</b> consists of at least one data stream
declared as a <b>source</b> and one data stream declared as a
<b>destination</b>.
</p>
<p>
There are three configuration types for io streams:
</p>
<p>
<b>Type 1  (one-to-one)</b>:<br>
One <b>source</b> with one <b>destination</b><br>
<pre>
 ------   (data)   --------   (data)
| src  |--------->|ioproxy |---------> dest.
 ------            -------- 
</pre>
</p>
<p>

<b>Type 2 (one-to-many)</b><br>
One <b>source</b> with multiple <b>destinations</b><br>
<pre>
                    --------  (data)
 ------   (data)   |ioproxy |---------> dest.
| src  | --------->|        | (data)
 ------            |        |---------> dest.
                    --------
</pre>
</p>
<p>


<b>Type 3 (many-to-one)</b><br>
Multiple <b>sources</b> and a one <b>destination</b><br>


<pre>
               --------
      (data)  |ioproxy | 
src --------->|        |  (data)
      (data)  |        |---------> dest.
src --------->|        |
               -------- 
</pre>

<p>
In each type, there is a single, <b>primary</b> data stream connected to one
or more <b><b>secondary</b></b> data streams.
</p>



In a configuration, the following rules distinguish between <b>primary</b>
and <b>secondary</b> data streams:
</p>
<ol>
<li><b>primary</b> data stream appears first, before any <b>secondary</b> data streams.
<li><b>primary</b> data stream includes the <b>dir</b> keyword/value to indicating direction of data stream (src/dst).
<li>There is only a single <b>primary</b> data stream defined per config.
<li>each <b>secondary</b> data stream appears after the <b>primary</b> and is contained within opening and closing parenthesis.
<li>There may be any number of <b>secondary</b> data streams.
</ol>
<p>
If the <b>primary</b> is declared as a <b>source</b>, then all <b>secondary</b> data streams are by default <b>destinations</b> and vice versa.
</p>
<p>
The config file may hold multiple configurations.  Each configuration begins with an opening '{' and ends with a closing '}'
</p>
<p>
An example configuration for a <b>type 1</b> config would be:
<pre>
{
   iotype: FILE; dir: src; path: /var/log/messages; 
  (iotype: FILE; path: /tmp/messages;)
}
</pre>
Observations:
<ol>
<li>Data streams contain keyword/value pairs.
<li>Each keyword value pair is terminated with a semi-colon.
<li>Each keyword is followd by a colon and one or more spaces and a value;
<li>Each data stream declares a value for <b>iotype</b>.
<li>The keyword <b>iotype</b> is the first keyword used.
<li>The keyword/value pair <b>dir: src;</b> defines the <b>primary</b><br>
as a <b>source</b> data stream from which data will be read.
<li>The <b>secondary</b> stream is defined after the <b>primary</b> and is<br>
enclosed in parenthesis.
</ol>
A <b>type 2</b> config example:
<pre>
{
  iotype: FILE; dir: src; path: /var/log/messages; 
  (iotype: FILE; path: /tmp/messages;)
  (iotype: PIPE; pipe_cmd: /usr/bin/data_parser;)
}
</pre>
This type only differs from a <b>type 1</b> by the additional <b>secondary</b> data
stream(s).
</p>
A <b>type 3</b> config example:
<pre>
{
  iotype: STDOUT; dir: dst;
  (iotype: SSH; host: host1; ssh_cmd: tail -f /var/log/authlog;)
  (iotype: SSH; host: host2; ssh_cmd: tail -f /var/log/auth;)
}
</pre>
<p>

This configuration defines the <b>primary</b> stream as a
<b>destination</b> to which data will be written.  In this case, the
<b>destination</b> is ioproxy's STDOUT, which will be the user's
terminal if exec'd from the user's shell. The <b>source</b> data comes
from executing `tail -f' on two different files on two different
hosts.

</p>


<h2>I/O TYPES</h2>
<p>

In the configuration, the <b>iotype</b> keyword identifies the I/O
type. It is required for each data stream and must be the first
keyword option specified.  Possible values are:
<ol>
<li><b>TCP_SOCK</b> - TCP socket
<li><b>UDP_SOCK</b> - UDP socket
<li><b>UNIX_SOCK</b> - local, unix socket
<li><b>FILE</b> - a regular file
<li><b>FIFO</b> - a FIFO
<li><b>STDIN</b> - STDIN
<li><b>STDOUT</b> - STDOUT
<li><b>PIPE</b> - an IPC channel to the STDIN or STDOUT of locally exec'd process
<li><b>SSH</b> - connection(source only*)
</ol>
<p>


</p>
<p>
Different I/O types have different options available for
configuration.  Some options are required, some not.  Some are common
to all I/O types and some for only a specific I/O type.
</p>
<p>
The following options are available to all I/O types:
<ol>
<li><b>bufsiz</b> - length (in bytes) of data buffer for reads/writes.<br>
This sets the maximum size of a read or write operation.  This option is<br>
relevant for type 3 (many-to-one) configurations and is discussed in the<br>
section 'section'.
<li><b>dir</b> - defines io stream as either a source or destination.<br>
This is required for the primary io stream only (otherwise it's ignored).
<li><b>nonblock</b> - sets the socket/file descriptor to use non-blocking I/O.<br>
For the FIFO io type, non-blocking I/O is set by default and cannot
be changed.
</ol>
<p>

What follows is a list of I/O types, their required/non-required
config options, and further information relevant to their usage.
<h3>FILE</h3>
The FILE iotype is used for regular files on a local filesystem.<br>
Required Vars:<br>
<ol>
<li><b>path</b> - full pathname of file<br>
</ol>
Optional Vars: (none)<br>
<br>
<p>
File will be created if it does not already exists.  If file is a
<b>destination</b>, writes will append to file; if a <b>source</b> the
file is read indefinitely (e.g., as in `tail -f`)
</p>
<p>
<h3>FIFO</h3>
A FIFO on the local filesystem.<br>
Required Vars:<br>
<ol>
<li><b>path</b> - full pathname of FIFO<br>
</ol>
Optional Vars: (none)<br>
<br>
Will be created if doesn't already exist.  Uses non-blocking I/O by
default
</p>
<p>
<h3>PIPE</h3>

A local process spawned by ioproxy.  I/O is read from STDOUT or
written to STDIN of new process.<br>

Required Vars:<br>
<ol>
<li><b>pipe_cmd</b> - full path to command to exec, plus args.  No enclosing quotes.<br>
</ol>
Optional Vars: (none)<br>
</p>
<p>
<h3>SSH</h3>
A command run on a remote host using SSH protocol.  Data is read from new proc's STDOUT.<br>
Required Vars:<br>
<ol>
<li><b>ssh_cmd</b>  - command to exec on remote host; no enclosing quotes
<li><b>host</b> - name of remote host, <b>or</b>
<li><b>ip</b> - IPv4 addr of remote host
</ol>
<i>(If both <b>host</b> and <b>ip</b> are given, the value for <b>ip</b> will be used.</i><br>
<br>
Optional Vars: (none)<br>
</p>
<p>
<h3>UNIX_SOCK</h3>
A local, unix socket.
Required Vars:
</p>
<ol>
<li><b>path</b> = full pathname to unix socket in local filesystem
<li><b>conn</b> = [SERVER|CLIENT] - connect to server specified in <i>path</i> (CLIENT), or<br>
     create socket at <i>path</i> and listen for incoming connections (SERVER)
</ol>
Optional Vars:<br>
<ol>
<li><b>sockproto</b> - [DGRAM|STREAM]; use socket as STREAM or DGRAM socket.
</ol>
<p>

If configured as a server, entry for socket in filesystem will be
created at startup and deleted at normal shutdown.  <i>ioproxy</i>
will return an error if filesystem entry for socket<br> already
exists.

</p>
<p>
<h3>UDP_SOCK</h3>
A UDP socket.<br>
Required Vars:<br>
<ol>
<li><b>conn</b> = [SERVER | CLIENT] - use CLIENT to send datagrams to <b>host</b>;<br>  
use SERVER to create a listening socket on <b>port</b> and listen for incoming UDP traffic.
<li><b>port</b> - network port on remote host
</ol>
Additional required vars if <b>conn</b> = CLIENT<br>
<ol>
<li><b>host</b> - name of host to connect to
<li><b>ip</b>   - IPv4 addr of host to connect to
</ol>
<i>(only 1 of the above are required.  If both are given, the value
for 'ip' will be used.)</i>
<br>
<br>
Optional Vars: (none)<br>
</p>
<p>
<h3>TCP_SOCK</h3>
A TCP socket.<br>
Required Vars:<br>
<ol>
<li><b>conn</b> = [SERVER | CLIENT] - use CLIENT to connect to <b>host</b>;<br>  
use SERVER to create a listening socket on <b>port</b> and listen for incoming connections.
<li><b>port</b> - network port
</ol>
Additional required vars if <b>conn</b> = CLIENT<br>
<ol>
<li><b>host</b> - name of host to connect to
<li><b>ip</b>   - IPv4 addr of host to connect to
</ol>
<i>(only 1 of the above are required.  If both are given, the value
for 'ip' will be used.</i>
<br><br>
Optional Vars:<br>
<ol>
<li><b>tls</b> - [true/false] - required to secure TCP connection with TLS.
<li><b>cacert</b> - full pathname to CA certificate
<li><b>cacertdir</b> - full path to a CA certificate directory
<li><b>reqcrt</b> - [true/false] - validate hostname in remote hosts certificate.  Defaults to true.
<li><b>host_cert</b> - a x509 certificate for host
<li><b>host_key</b> - private key associated with <b>host_cert</b>
<li><b>cli_vrfy</b> - for servers, request and validate a certificate from connecting clients.
</ol>

</p>
<p>
If using TLS, only one of <b>cacert</b> or <b>cacertdir</b> are
required to validate the identity of the remote host.  When used, the
remote host will be asked to provide a certificate to validate its
identity.
</p>
<p>

Both <b>our_cert</b> and <b>our_key</b> are required if the remote
host will request our certificate to validate our identity.
</p>
<p>
Typically a server sends these to clients to validate the identity of
the server.  Servers can also request a certificate from connecting
clients to validate their identity.

<pre>
BASIC EXAMPLE OF DESCRIPTOR I/O USAGE
-------------------------------------
1. Host A on an internal network needs log file data from Host B in
   DMZ.

2. Log daemon on Host B can write data locally to any file type, but
   to send data to another host, it needs to connect to a server
   (initiate outbound TCP connection)

3. Networking rules prohibit Host B in DMZ from initiating outbound
   TCP connections to any host on internal network.

4. Networking rules allow Host A to initiate TCP connections to Host B
   in the DMZ

Solution:
1. On Host B in DMZ, configure <i>ioproxy</i> to:
   i. open the data source (which is wherever the log daemon is
   configured to write data: file, unix socket, FIFO, etc.
   ii. open listening TCP port that uses TLS and writes data from
   source to authenticated clients.

2. On Host A, configure <i>ioproxy</i> to:
   i.  connect to Host B's TCP port and read incoming data
   ii. write incoming data to file (or user terminal, FIFO,
   etc)
